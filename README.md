# Hello-world- my name is Francis and 
It my first time using GitHub it looks so hard 
At first but I will never give up ... Ever since 
I was a child I always want to code
 mixing alphabet and numbers I always want to be a nerd
To every feild there is so much I can bring to life
Through my imagination... If only I work with the right team 
My journey start now .....
